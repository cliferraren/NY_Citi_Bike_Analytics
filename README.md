# Citi Bike Analytics

## Background

![Citi-Bikes](Images/citi-bike-station-bikes.jpg)

Our team has been task to create and implement a dashboard as a reporting process to the City officials. 

Pros: 
1. Implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization - Implementation in 2013 of the [New York Citi Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike) Program.
2. Good data collection - Each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.


Challenges:
1. Build a set of data reports to provide the answers to a number of questions on the program. 
2. Large amount of various data to be collected - largest bike sharing program in the United States.


Objective:

Generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

  

## Task

**Our task is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to build a data dashboard, story, or report.  We may work with a timespan of our choosing. Optionally, we may merge multiple datasets from different periods. The following are some questions we may wish to tackle, especially if we are working with merged datasets.**

* How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?

* By what percentage has total ridership grown? 

* How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months? 

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)

* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)

* Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?

* How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?

* How does the average trip duration change by age?

* What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?

* Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan? 

* How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

**Additionally, city officials would like to see the following visualizations:**

* A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.

* If we're working with a merged dataset: a dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year) -- with commentary pointing to any interesting events that may be behind these phenomena.

**Lastly, as a chronic over-achiever:**

* Find at least two unexpected phenomena in the data and provide a visualization and analysis to document their presence.
